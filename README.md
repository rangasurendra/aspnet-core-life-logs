# aspnet-core-life-logs
Purpose:

Different teams use different versions and different platform combinations of ASP.NET Core, .NET Framework, .NET Core and .NET Standard. Also, ASP.NET Core being a rapidly evolving platform it has its owns hickups with the tools like VS and VSTS. Different versions require different settings and different configurations. This repo is a central place to log the experiences of the developers who use ASP.NET core with different combinations and different tools. 

Date is a critical factor of this log as the entire topic is a moving target as we get version updates and patches. This would help the developers to the understand platform, chop down their decision making time and find solutions for the problems they face.
